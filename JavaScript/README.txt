This is an example file for a good answer format. Here are the instructions. I'm using the first ever exercise in Python as my example.

1. Find/create the folder for the correct language.
2. Find/create the correct directory for the course topic.
3. Create/add your answer to a file named <sub-course>-<section>-<exercise number>. So 1-1-1 refers to the "Python Syntax" sub-course, "Variables and Data Types" section and "Welcome to the Flying Circus!" exercise.

The above formats can be changed depending on better practices or better ideas. I'm not perfect. This is just an idea. :)

Sincerely,

Dustin
